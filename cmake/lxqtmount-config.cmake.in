#
#  LXQTMOUNT_FOUND         - Set to TRUE if all of the above has been found
#
#  LXQTMOUNT_INCLUDE_DIR   - The lxqt include directory
#
#  LXQTMOUNT_INCLUDE_DIRS  - The lxqt and the Qt include directory, for use with INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES()
#
#  LXQTMOUNT_LIBRARY_DIRS  - The lxqt and the Qt library directory
#
#  LXQTMOUNT_LIBRARIES     - The libraries needed to use lxqt
#
#  LXQTMOUNT_USE_FILE       - The variable LXQTMOUNT_USE_FILE is set which is the path to a CMake file that
#                        can be included to compile lxqt applications and libraries. It sets up
#                        the compilation environment for include directories and populates a
#                        LXQTMOUNT_LIBRARIES variable.
